The aim of this project is to get to a point where I can calculate checksum of storage blocks.
Steps
1. A userspace server gets what to execute (checksum) and when (on block I/O)
2. compile and prepare
3. load the code
4. get data periodically

What is the difference between compiling with clang and llvm VS. the CMake HelloWorld.cpp program?

As I understand we do not have to program in eBPF bytecode. There are plenty of higher level helper functions around.

TODO:
1. https://github.com/torvalds/linux/tree/master/samples/bpf - compile and load cpustat_* code using the bcc toolchain
outside the kernel tree.

2. Write your own code using llvm and clang toolchain
